# Examples

To test-run these examples, please:
  1. `cd` into this examples directory, then copy the `_client.rb.example` file to a new file named `_client.rb`.
  2. Modify it by inserting your credentials or authentication token, ssl_enabled flag, and anything else your environment requires.

Now you can run the example files to test functionality of individual resources.
